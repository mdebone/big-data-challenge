# Initial import
Okays so the Resources folder works as intended mostly. The two PDF files imported without a problem. The two SQL files imported without a problem.
The only difficuly was the Amazon Reviews Dataset, I have familiarity in changing txt files to READMEs and they never become unstable, however I tried a few times to get the html file,
to change to this s3 nonsense, a broswer I have no lived experience with and it wont change, this is becauase it is riddled with '.'s throughout and html and apparently s3 thinks taht those
are full stop, the html is over, so going to have to work on that. 

Obviously got the first part the http fixed, and most of the periods at the fron and the back easilty enough, its the ones in the middle that are giving me trouble, I suspect that they
will become underscores, but only time will tell. I imported the unnamed ipynb that will become a google colab destination, although there was no naming convention provided, luckily, it is 
the only ipynb file in the repo so with or without a predefined name its easy enough to pick out. 

As there are no instructions regarding the two level-1 and level-2 directories, they're there but it remains to be seen what will populate inside of them. 

Also not sure if I am supposed to import to either of them other then a few lines of imports and an import os function for both of them

Got it resolved, downloaded the two sql files and put them in the main directory, and removed the two gz files

I don't know what happened, this was all already supposed to be pushed
